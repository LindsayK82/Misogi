                    <h3>Step #1 Collect Plastic: </h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step is collecting plastic from the landfills, oceans, or even cities.
                        It is massively important to ensure this doesnâ€™t harm the natural habitat of animals and marine life.
                        From plastic bottles to containers, all plastic products are gathered up and sent to a plastic processing factory.

                <div className='col-md-6'>
                    <h3>Step #2 Break It Down: </h3>
                    <p>
                        Those plastic products are separated, and the recyclable plastic is passed through a chopping machine that breaks everything down into small chips, once all the paper labels are removed.
                        Those chunky plastic chips are further processed to turn them into the machine to make them finer.

                    <h3>Step #3 Melt The Chips:</h3>
                    <p>
                        All the processed, fine plastic chips are thrown into a melting machine that treats the plastic at high heat.
                        The melted plastic is then filtered to remove any kind of impurity.
                        This step is essential to bring the plastic to phase-1 of the recycled fabric making process.

                    <h3>Step #4 Spin It Into Yarn:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once all the plastic is melted and filtered, it goes through the spinning process.
                        The melted plastic is turned into polyester yarns and spun together with the yarn of choice to make the plastic fabric wearable.
                        The yarn is collected and passed on to the weaving department.

                    <h3>Step #5 Weave The Fabric:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The last step is weaving the polyester into the fabric.
                        You can make anything, it is all up to your imagination!
