# Misogi

## Description

Waste from various industries impact all of us and the planet. For this project, we wanted to build a site that can offer facts about the waste of the fabric industry, and inspire ways to help.

AS A USER:
-I would like to be able to see a homepage with facts;
-I would like to be able to register a profile and login;
-I would like to be able to view and register for events;
-I would like to know where to buy some of the products made from recycled materials.

The development team made a plan to solve all of the user needs listed above. By creating this site, we hope to be a driving force in repairing our planet.
